==MY DOT FILES
For me to set up new machines. I guess you can look at them. They're probably a mess. But they're mine.

Do these things:
 * set up your ~/.tmp folder
 * get liquidprompt 
 * set your default login shell to /bin/zsh
 * get iTerm2 installed
 * set iterm terminal emulation to xterm-256color

and of course install ack, and git, and homebrew, and rvm (and gitflow and postgres and...).
