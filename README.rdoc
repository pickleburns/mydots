==MY DOT FILES
For me to set up new machines. I guess you can look at them. They're probably a mess. But they're mine.

Rememebr to set up your ~/.tmp folder

Remember to get liquidprompt and remember also set your default login shell to /bin/zsh

and of course install ack, and git, and homebrew, and rvm.
